meta-maker
================================

Introduction
-------------------------

This layer is intended to be the home of applications and tools for Makers 
in OpenEmbedded. While initial focus is on 3D printing, this is by no means
intended to be an exclusive layer. Other applications for CNC machining,
lasercutting, knitting, etc. are expected to follow and are welcome.
